        <p style="text-indent: 3%;">
            You know, today there is no story.
            I mean, there are a lot of stories about incredible souls who sacrificed their careers,
            a lot of things, everything even their lives for a better world, for nature, and after all
            for the whole of humankind.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 3%;">
            I think, there is no greater love. And, I deeply respect every religion,
            the following is not about that, it's about responsibility.
            Maybe we can play the game of children here as in the playground waiting for an angel,
            God, universe, miracle, or whatever as children wait for their parents to tidy up after what
            they did, but, I think, it's time to grow up and to take the responsibility for us, for our actions.
            I mean, if somebody hasn't done that already.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 3%;">
            And, of course, everybody has their path, it's not about doing this or that, just about doing
            what I can do in my own life. Doesn't matter that it is a "big" thing or a "little",
            it doesn't matter because everything counts.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 3%;">
            And you, it's not against development, progression, it's about being balanced with the natural flow,
            where there is a development, but not in a bad used way.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 3%;">
            And, I think, there is a very interesting question, how does the treatment of nature relate
            to the treatment of women? I'm not setting anything, just asking, how does it relate, how can?
            It's also the feminine energy, attitude and of course, it's not about women vs men: some women
            are maybe not exactly on the right track
            (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMFtM7abCDI" target="_blank">music</a>)
            and there are gentle, wise, mature men. It's not about that, it's about the feminine part and treatment.
            There is some kind of relation or not?
            (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bag1gUxuU0g" target="_blank">music</a>)
            How can it relate or not? I think it could be a good research.
            And, of course, things can be even more complex when the old patterns are realised,
            just cannot go out of them.
            (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2BNiR5GtcQ" target="_blank">music</a>) Or
            other perspectives
            (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwpMEbgC7DA" target="_blank">music</a>).
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 3%;">
            Yes, things can be very complex, I think, but, what is most important is to clarify ourselves.
            To catch these little or bigger traps that don't allow the natural flow. It can be anything.
            And I think, maybe one of the major problems is the conquest of the ego.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 3%;">
            You know, there is a knowingness. When you just know the things.
            When you know that you know something better, or you have a better ability for something than the other,
            because you just know it, you are not stupid, but there is no feeling that you are better.
            That's the difference between ego and non-ego. Ego has the feeling that they are better,
            but in knowingness, it isn't there. I'm not feeling that I'm "better", that is the non-ego,
            the knowingness. I respect everybody for their path where they are, and I respect the path where currently
            I am even maybe I know some things better, but I'm not "better" or more "special" than the others.
            That's the non-ego. I mean, as I see, but everybody can debate about that. And for the opposite also:
            if I see somebody who is better at something than me, then I don't start these power,
            ego games like an idiot, I just respect the other for who they are and learn from them and don't
            have these things like who is "better" or not. Of course, problems start when one or both go into the
            game which can be an infinite loop or some kind of deadlock.:D
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 3%;">
            And it is for everything, to be absolutely clear about myself because it has a lot of benefits.
            Not just for others, if maybe it won't be enough motivation,:D but for myself also, because
            how do I want to see the world better, if I don't see myself well, i.e.,
            if the origo is not in the right place?
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 3%;">
            For example, if I have an attribute of vanity, how can I really see the world,
            and things around me?
        <p style="text-indent: 3%;">
            And yes, that's the real challenge, to recognise the false beliefs and sensations,
            because they give a sense of trueness.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 3%;">
            It's hard, painful, and can be very scary, especially if somebody grows up in that kind of
            environment where a lot of things were accepted as
            truths(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95HqlWRFrAk" target="_blank">music</a>)
            and now the whole perception has to fall apart.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 3%;">
            And I think, it's not easy to live, and it wasn't easy ever generally speaking.
            And there can be hard times when it seems like everything is lost,
            even hope (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rwq5NqUyokU" target="_blank">music</a>).
            And even sometimes it feels like a prison, but hopefully, paradise can be
            found (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G4isv_Fylg" target="_blank">music</a>)
            where paradise is where the love is no matter
            how it looks like.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 3%;">
            And the trust. I think, there is no more precious thing after health than trust.
            Of course, for those who are interested in how to trick others,
            it's maybe not so precious or just for using it, but for those, who
            are really that, those understand it. It's really a moment of
            peace (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL-AOXLq6vQ" target="_blank">music</a>)
            when you find those who can be really trusted and who can
            also trust you. You know, it's a two-direction connection.
            In any kind of "packing": a partner, a friend, a
            co-worker, or whatever. And, not least, we even don't have to love each other,
            but we can be correct.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 3%;">
            And, again there is an interesting thing that I think, sometimes it's really hard to
            see who is who and who can be really trusted. Sometimes, maybe I see somebody who seems
            to be selfish, evil, or whatever, but this is just a surface, and really can't
            know (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pgmFAOgm5E" target="_blank">music</a>).
            I really deeply liked Disney's
            interpretation of Maleficent, because excluding these magical things just seeing the essence,
            it really shows a lot of things. Maleficent wasn't bad even after, she protected nature,
            the weak ones, who didn't know how to protect themselves and just her wings were cut after
            she gave trust. Can you imagine, how it feels just because of these pity things like power,
            money, wealth, etc.? And, of course, a person should be aware of everything, but, you know,
            sometimes, it can happen that also. Of course, some bad people just do not seem like that,
            but they are really that, but sometimes something has to look deeper. You know, the essence,
            always the essence is the question, what stands behind things? The same packaging can have a
            different essence and different packaging can have the same essence and, of course,
            things can be even very complex also multi-dimensionally.
        <p style="text-indent: 3%;">
            And you know, there is an interesting thing that there are a lot of "tests" who is who and
            whatever, but I think, I found the simplest test and the most efficient.
            I'll tell just for free, and, of course, as I see, but everybody can debate about that.
            It is just to see how the person behaves with those who are "under" or in some that kind of
            position where there is no "bet". That is that simple, because, as they behave with those who are
            under them or wherever just without a bet, they will behave with their bosses, seniors,
            whoever in the same manner when these persons become in that position without a bet.
            Because what will make a difference? What can be a reason why not if there is really
            nothing to bet? Of course, the implementation of seeing that can be sometimes hard,:D
            and I think, there are no "coincidences" as to why a lot of tails, and fabulae about that:
            why opportunities, possibilities, and potentials come in disguise.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 3%;">
            So, yes, there can be a lot of things, a lot of manifestation and I think,
            everything is connected in the sense that in everything a little step leads to a better world.
            And a question arose to me what could stand behind every non-balanced thing?
            I found that maybe the answer is that something is missing inside, but this leads to a
            philosophical path of religion, speculations, and everything like that.
            Something is missing inside, and it would like to get from the outer world unconsciously
            not knowing exactly what is trying to get, but somehow trying to get from the outer world.
            Through things, resources, money, wealth, power, relationships, sex, drugs, alcohol, work, etc....
            to fulfill that missing feeling. And what is that missing feeling?
            Well, first, it has to be proven that really exists,
            but if it does, there are a lot of potentials through religion and theories
            like the lost paradise, the twin soul, the higher self, the enlightenment, getting back to
            The One, a breath of life
            (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha-X9qh5Kdo" target="_blank">music</a>),
            etc... what is interesting that the common thing is that something is missing.
            Really interesting, and, of course, a very philosophical observation.
            I thought about it, and I think, can be whatever, and no matter whether it is true or not,
            but I found that there can be something which is surely good anyway no matter that
            it is true or not. A simple, but maybe the hardest thing which is nothing
            but self-love (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InBiaRBUjUs" target="_blank">music</a>).
            When you love yourself, but not in an egoistic way comparing yourself to others,
            because in self-love there is nobody.

        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 3%;">
            I think everybody has somebody who they really love.
            You know that they are maybe not perfect, you know, that they are trying their best,
            so, I think it's something like that. I think it can be said as an acceptance
            and natural flow that even the mind doesn't know how to interpret.
            It seems like a simple and ordinary thing that
            of course, the ego doesn't like, the ego likes "extraordinary things",
            and the mind doesn't know how to interpret, because it likes or has a tendency
            to complicate things, analyse, categorise, take apart, which, of course,
            in some situations is good, but, I think, some things are hard to catch through
            this, and it's an ordinary and simple thing like every beauty and a real treasure
            (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJpQJWpVJds" target="_blank">music</a>).
            And I can love, and accept myself even while I'm not perfect, because, why not?
            And why I cannot see the higher picture with all potentials also?
            As I gently love others, I can be to myself as gentle as
            too (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKNxeF4KMsY" target="_blank">music</a>).
            I know that maybe I'm not perfect,
            I know that maybe I'm not the smartest, the most beautiful, the funniest,
            whatever person, but then what? I can love myself and in fact, does it really matter?
            Everybody is special and I think, the most important thing is what kind of person
            I am. But, that's what I think and everybody can chase for whatever.
            And, of course, true love isn't blind, it sees the beauty and the higher
            potentials also, but I can see things that I can improve,
            that's all right, but it doesn't take away love, I'm not feeling unworthy
            because why it should do?
            And forgiveness: yesterday was a different day, today is a new day for what I
            did yesterday. I take responsibility, but today I'm a new person without that.
            Even though some things can be hard also,
            because, why they can't be? I think, there is a difference, between how I am with
            myself and how some things
            make me sad, angry, hard, or whatever even though there can be a connection,
            but doesn't have to be.
            I can be good with myself while things can make me sad as seeing other's suffering,
            some experiences, etc. So, I think, it isn't a bad thing in any sense no matter
            what is true or not.
            And there are no more power games, because why should there be?
            I'm not trying to get somebody else's attention, admiration, other resources,
            money, power, position, prestige, or whatever as a beggar. And, of course,
            it doesn't exclude a true, lovely, relationship with others, because,
            why should it do? Just now not two beggars meet, but those who have something
            to give.
        </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 3%;">
            So yes, I think, it's interesting and maybe can be a solution for a lot of things.
            And of course, being whatever or however, unfortunately,
            some people don't choose the light side of the path in that current position
            of space and time where they are even if it is told to them a million times, they just become angrier
            or just not interested in, and sometimes it seems like a mission
            impossible (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRCeBJpYiEE" target="_blank">music</a>)
            to get this Earth as a new Eden, but, who knows. It's been said every road leads to Rome,
            so, maybe there is hope, and whatever happens of whatever, I think, life will always exist or
            will recreate itself.
